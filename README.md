# Random Walk NFT

Random Walk NFT is an on-chain generative art project on Arbitrum, utilizing a 'random walk' algorithm to create unique art. It pairs innovative game theory and decentralized economics, where minters compete to be the last one to mint an NFT for a substantial Ether reward. The project, governed by an immutable smart contract and powered by open-source tools, embodies transparency and longevity in the evolving NFT space.

- **What is Random Walk NFT?**  
Random Walk NFT is an on-chain generative art project based on a mathematical process known as a random walk. Itâ€™s deployed on Ethereum's Layer 2 solution, Arbitrum, and offers a unique blend of art, economics, and game theory.

- **How does a random walk work in this context?**  
The art for each NFT is generated through a process similar to taking random steps on a grid. You can imagine standing at a point and randomly deciding to move in one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. This process is repeated millions of times, with the path created forming the basis of the art. The colors are generated by randomly tweaking the red, green, and blue channels after every step.

- **Can I predict what my Random Walk NFT will look like before minting?**  
No, the image is generated based on a seed that is randomly calculated at the time of minting. This ensures every piece of art is unique and unpredictable.

- **How does the game theory aspect work in Random Walk NFT?**  
The project involves a competition among minters. If you mint an NFT and nobody else mints another for 30 days, you receive 50% of the total ETH accumulated up to that point through minting. If someone mints after you within that 30-day period, the game resets with the remaining ETH.

- **Who controls the Random Walk NFT project?**  
The project is completely managed by an immutable smart contract, making it autonomous and transparent. Nobody, including the creators, can alter the rules or withdraw ETH from the contract.

- **Is there a limit to the number of Random Walk NFTs that can be minted?**  
There's no hard cap on the total number of these NFTs. However, the price to mint increases by about 0.1% after every mint, which naturally limits the total number minted.

- **How is the reward determined in the Random Walk NFT game?**  
The reward is dynamic and is directly tied to the minting activity. The ratio between the mint price and the reward will always be 400x. This means that as the mint price increases, so does the potential reward.

- **How do the creators of Random Walk NFT make money?**  
The creators of the project do not directly receive any of the ETH spent on minting. The only way they could potentially profit is if the value of the Random Walk NFTs increases. The creators, like everyone else, minted some NFTs early when it was cheaper to mint.

- **What happens when it becomes too expensive to mint a Random Walk NFT?**  
Once it becomes prohibitively expensive to mint, the last person to have minted an NFT would win, receiving half of all the ETH accumulated in the pot at that point.

- **What is the connection between the Random Walk NFT and Ethereum Layer 2 Arbitrum?**  
Random Walk NFT is deployed on Arbitrum, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution. This offers lower gas fees compared to Ethereum's mainnet, while maintaining the same level of security.

- **What happens to my NFT if the Random Walk NFT team disappears?**  
Given the immutable and autonomous nature of the smart contract, the project will continue to function as normal even if the team were to disappear. Your NFT and any potential rewards are protected by the blockchain and not dependent on the team's presence.

- **How are the NFT images generated?**  
The images for Random Walk NFTs are generated using an open source Python program. This program uses the unique seed associated with each NFT to generate a distinct and unpredictable piece of art.

- **Where is the Random Walk NFT generation program stored?**  
The Python program that generates the NFT images is stored on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System). This decentralized system ensures the accessibility and permanence of the program.

- **Can anyone use the Random Walk NFT generation program?**  
Absolutely! As an open source program, anyone can use it to create a competing site or regenerate the images. This is quite different from many other NFT projects and speaks to the decentralized, open nature of Random Walk NFT.

- **What happens to the NFT images if the Random Walk NFT team disappears?**  
Because the image generation program is open source and stored on IPFS, anyone can regenerate the images at any time, even if the Random Walk NFT team were to disappear. This ensures the permanence and independent existence of your NFTs.

- **Can anyone change the rules of the Random Walk NFT game?**  
No, the rules of the Random Walk NFT game are entirely controlled by the smart contract. This means that no one, including the creators, can change the rules or withdraw Ether from the contract. This ensures the game's fairness and immutability.

- **How does the reward system work in the Random Walk NFT game?**  
If there is no minting activity for 30 days, the last person to mint an NFT becomes the winner and receives 50% of all the ETH in the pot at that time. The game then resets and continues with the remaining ETH.

- **How does the increasing mint price affect the game?**  
The mint price increases by about 0.1% after each mint. This means that as more NFTs are minted, it becomes more expensive to mint new ones. At some point, it will become too expensive, and the last minter will win the game.

- **What happens to the ETH paid for minting?**  
None of the ETH paid for minting goes to the creators; it all goes towards the game. This ETH makes up the pot, half of which is rewarded to the last minter if there's no minting activity for 30 days.

- **How does the Random Walk NFT team profit from the project?**  
The team behind Random Walk NFT does not directly profit from the minting process. The only way they could potentially make money is if the value of the Random Walk NFTs appreciates. The team minted some NFTs early on when it was cheaper, like all other participants.
